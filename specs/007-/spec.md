## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer maintaining the jimeng-web-mcp codebase, I need the continue generation feature to be maintainable, memory-safe, and follow clean code principles so that:
- Long-running MCP servers don't experience memory leaks
- Future developers can understand and modify the code easily
- Edge cases are properly handled
- Production deployments are reliable

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the MCP server runs for 24 hours with 1000 image generation requests, **When** monitoring memory usage, **Then** memory consumption should remain stable without unbounded growth

2. **Given** a developer needs to modify the continuation logic, **When** reviewing the submitImageTask method, **Then** the code should be clear, well-structured, and under 50 lines per method

3. **Given** multiple concurrent image generation requests, **When** continuation is triggered, **Then** no race conditions or duplicate submissions should occur

4. **Given** a user submits a prompt already containing "‰∏ÄÂÖ±5Âº†Âõæ", **When** requesting 5 images, **Then** the final prompt should not contain duplicate count declarations

5. **Given** production logs need analysis, **When** reviewing log output, **Then** logs should use proper levels (debug/info/warn/error) instead of console.log with emojis

### Edge Cases
- What happens when cache grows beyond reasonable limits in long-running processes?
- How does system handle concurrent continuation requests for the same historyId?
- What if user cancels a task - does stale cache data remain forever?
- How are partial failures handled when some images succeed but others fail?
- What if appending count text exceeds API prompt length limits?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Memory Management
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically clean up cached data when tasks complete to prevent memory leaks
- **FR-002**: System MUST limit cache size with appropriate eviction policies (e.g., LRU, TTL)
- **FR-003**: System MUST release all cached resources (asyncTaskCache, continuationSent, requestBodyCache) for completed tasks

#### Code Maintainability
- **FR-004**: Request building logic MUST be separated into focused, single-responsibility methods (each under 50 lines)
- **FR-005**: Magic numbers (4, 30, 50, etc.) MUST be replaced with named constants explaining their meaning
- **FR-006**: Duplicate code patterns MUST be extracted into reusable helper methods

#### Robustness
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate user prompts to avoid duplicate count declarations when auto-appending text
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle concurrent continuation requests without race conditions or duplicate submissions
- **FR-009**: System MUST use explicit coordination between smart and manual continuation mechanisms

#### Observability
- **FR-010**: System MUST use structured logging with appropriate levels (debug/info/warn/error)
- **FR-011**: Debug logs MUST be suppressible in production environments
- **FR-012**: System MUST NOT log sensitive data (API tokens, user prompts containing PII)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task Cache Entry**: Represents cached parameters for a generation task
  - Key attributes: historyId, generation parameters, uploaded images, API params
  - Lifecycle: Created on task start, should be cleaned up on completion
  - Relationships: Three separate caches currently exist (asyncTaskCache, continuationSent, requestBodyCache)

- **Continuation State**: Represents whether continuation has been triggered for a task
  - Key attributes: historyId, sent flag
  - Purpose: Prevent duplicate continuation submissions
  - Relationship: Tied to task lifecycle, should be cleaned up with task cache

- **Request Body Cache**: Stores original API request parameters for reuse
  - Key attributes: submitId, draftContent, metricsExtra, extend
  - Purpose: Enable continuation requests to reuse original parameters
  - Lifecycle: Created on first request, currently never cleaned up

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs (developer experience, production reliability)
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (business impact explained)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (memory stability, method line counts, log levels)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (code quality improvements only, no new features)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (based on code review findings)

---

## Execution Status

- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted (memory leak, complexity, robustness, observability)
- [x] Ambiguities marked (none - issues clearly documented in code review)
- [x] User scenarios defined (developer maintenance, production reliability)
- [x] Requirements generated (12 functional requirements across 4 categories)
- [x] Entities identified (cache structures and lifecycle)
- [x] Review checklist passed

## Notes

This specification addresses critical code quality issues identified in the code-quality-pragmatist agent review:

**Priority 1 (Critical)**: Memory leak in static caches
**Priority 2 (High)**: Code complexity in submitImageTask method
**Priority 3 (High)**: Fragile prompt manipulation
**Priority 4 (Medium)**: Duplicate cache logic and unreliable duplicate detection
**Priority 5 (Medium)**: Excessive debug logging

The requirements focus on making the code production-ready, maintainable, and following clean code principles without changing the feature's external behavior.
